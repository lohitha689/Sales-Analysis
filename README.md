#Sales Analysis

🔵 Page 1: Executive Summary

✅ KPIs:
Total Sales: ₹2M
Total Orders: 4,922
Avg Sales per Order: ₹459

🟣 These figures indicate a healthy customer base and steady transaction volume, with a solid average order value. Growth opportunities may lie in increasing customer LTV or boosting order size.

📈 Sales Trend (2015–2018):
Clear seasonal peaks, especially in Q4 (Nov–Dec).
Strong year-over-year momentum.
Insight: Seasonality suggests corporate budgeting cycles and holiday demand drive Q4 spikes. Future promotions can target these months for revenue maximization.

West region leads, followed by East and Central.
South region underperforms noticeably.
Action: Investigate market penetration in the South—logistics, marketing reach, or regional pricing could be causes.

🟡 Page 4: Shipping Analysis

🚚 Order-to-Ship Days by Month:
Shipping times peak mid-year, dip in Q4.
Insight: Faster shipping during Q4 might be due to pre-holiday fulfillment pressure—good for customer experience. Summer delays might hurt retention.

📍 Shipping by Region:

West has longest shipping delays, followed by East.
South has fewer orders but faster delivery—possibly due to smaller demand.
Recommendation: Improve logistics in West, as it’s the top-selling region but suffers most from delays.
